                    <ol>
                    <li>Header - Unnessary “+” in the upper-right corner</li>
                    <li>Homepage - “Does your company need to do, ” the boxes are not clickable. If there were links, they could guide visitors to their services.</li>
                    <li>Homepage - “What we do, ” the process icons are not clickable, it could link to the “Our Services” page</li>
                    <li>Footer - extremely un-legible Linkedin icon</li>
                    <li>Our Service - “LEARNING SOLUTIONS, ”  the time delay is too fast, besides, there are no titles which would cause confusion. Instead of text explanation, Work Samples should link  to the boxes.</li>

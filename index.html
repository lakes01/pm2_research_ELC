        <h2>Ben's User Persona</h2>
            <img class="persona-photo" src="img/andrew-yao.jpg" alt="photo of andrew">
            <div class="content">
                <h4>Demographics</h4>
                    <table>
                    <tr><th>Name:</th><td>Andrew Yao</td></tr>
                    <tr><th>Gender:</th><td>Male</td></tr>
                    <tr><th>Age:</th><td>late 40s</td></tr>
                    <tr><th>Company:</th><td>Poly-tech Digital Solution</td></tr>
                    <tr><th>Title:</th><td>Marketing Manager</td></tr>
                </table>
                <h4>Preference</h4>
                <p>Mr. Yao does not have any experience working with a consulting company to design training material for sales and marketing people. He did a presentation by himself to train his sales staff. Recently, their company is considering exploring the market in the United States. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, He would like to have interactive training material for his sales staff and clients in North America. </p>
                <h4>Experience</h4>
                <p>Andrew opened the Cantilever website. At the homepage, he scrolled down to the <b>"Does your company need to ..."</b> He found the <b>Training Staff</b> box, he was expecting there was a link, so he clicked but nothing happened. So, he looked up at the navigation and clicked <b>Our Service</b>. He scrolled down to the <b>LEARNING SOLUTIONS</b>, and clicked the box of <b>Marketing Materials</b>. The box flipped so quickly that he forgot what was the front title. Again, he thought there was a link to another page to know the details or any samples. "No, there is no link." Andrew went back to the menu and clicked <b>Work Samples</b> page. <br><br>Andrew skimmed and thought the <b>Product Training</b> was what he wanted. He looked into details and found that material was for the school, not for businesses.  He went back <b>Work Samples</b>  page, and found another box <b>Business Strategy for Designers</b>. There were too many texts, Andrew was finding himself losing patient. He just glanced at the pictures below the text, he determined that this was for software design without reading more. Andrew went back <b>Work Samples</b> page, he went back from the bottom back to top again. He would not continue browsing this company if it was not an interview. He thought loudly, "OK, let me click the <b>Pharmaceutical Sales Training</b>. Em, this looks like what I want." Andrew decided to contact the company, and click the <b>Contact Us</b> page. </p>

                    <li>Footer - extremely un-legible Linkedin icon</li>
                    <li>Our Service - “LEARNING SOLUTIONS, ”  the time delay is too fast, besides, there are no titles which would cause confusion. Instead of text explanation, Work Samples should link  to the boxes.</li>
                    <li>Our Clients- the logs should be clickable, direct to the Work Samples page or their clients' websites.</li>

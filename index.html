        <h2>Ben's User Persona</h2>
            <img class="persona-photo" src="img/andrew-yao.jpg" alt="photo of andrew">
            <div class="content">
                <h4>Demographics</h4>
                    <table>
                    <tr><th>Name:</th><td>Andrew Yao</td></tr>

                    <tr><th>Title:</th><td>Marketing Manager</td></tr>
                </table>
                <h4>Experience & Preference</h4> 
                    <p>Mr. Yao does not have any experience working with a consulting company to design training material for sales and marketing people. The former company he worked with was an Italian company. All training materials were provided by the headquarter.</p><br>
                    <p>Mr.Yao joined Poly-tech who specialized in digital printing in 2020. Recently, Poly-tech is considering exploring the market in the United States. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Andrew would like to have interactive training material for his sales staff and clients in North America.     
                    (ps. He used Powerperpint to train his sales staff in Beijing and the USA using Ding Talk, but the result is not what he expected.)</p>
